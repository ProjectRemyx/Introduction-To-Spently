# Introduction to Spently
A site about who I am targeted towards Spently. This application is meant to solidify concepts using the MERN stack. 

The pricing cards near the bottom of the page are retrieving
information from a MongoDb database. The rest is done in React using custom HTML/CSS.

Site is currently live at: https://hi-spently.herokuapp.com
